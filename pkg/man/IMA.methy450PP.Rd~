\title{
Data preprocessing and quality control
}
\description{
It allows user to choose several filtering step or modify filtering
criteria for specific quality control purpose includes:filtering
probes by the detetion Pvalue;whether remove the probes from the Xchrom; whether transfer data by using
square arcsine; whether normalize the data by using quantile normalization; whether remove the probes
containing missing values.
}
\usage{
IMA.methy450PP(data, na.omit = TRUE, normalization = FALSE, transfm = FALSE, filtersample = TRUE, filterdetectP = TRUE, detectPcut = 0.75, locidiff = FALSE, locidiffcut = 0.01, Xchrom = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
   \item{data}{
an exprmethy450 class returned by the lumi.methy450R function
}
  \item{na.omit}{
if TRUE remove the sites containing missing value
}
  \item{normalization}{
if TRUE, quantile normalization performed
}
  \item{transfm}{
if TRUE, arcsin square root of beta matrix is performed
}
  \item{filtersample}{
Keep the samples with detection Pvalue <10e-5 on more than 75\% sites 
}
  \item{filterdetectP}{
Remove the sites with detection Pvalue > 0.01 across  detectPcut percentage of the samples
}
  \item{detectPcut}{
Remove the sites with detection Pvalue > 0.01 across 75\% of the samples
}
\item{locidiff}{
if TRUE, keep the sites has big variance between two groups.
}
  \item{locidiffcut}{
if locidiff = TRUE, keep the sites has variance great than the locidiffcut between two groups
}
  \item{Xchrom}{
if TRUE, Remove the sites on chromosome X
 }
}
\details{
It allows user to choose several filtering step or modify filtering criteria for specific quality control purpose. By default, IMA will filter out loci with missing beta value, from the X chromosome or with median detection P-value greater than 0.05. The option for sample level quality control is also provided (B. C. Christensen et al., 2011). Although the raw beta values will be analyzed as recommended by Illumina, the user can choose Arcsine squareroot transformation.  Both scaling and quantile normalization options are available for cross sample normalization.
